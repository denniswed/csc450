In this module, we will explore working with pointers in the C++ programming language. How are pointers used with arrays, and what are the benefits to utilizing pointers? Are arrays necessary when using a pointer? Additionally, what is the difference between the address-of operator and the dereference operator in C++? Be sure to provide an appropriate example to illustrate your viewpoints.

Pointers are essentially used to reference a specific memory space. They don't
need to reference an array, but the benefits of using a pointer become more apparent with arrays because you can use the pointer to iterate through the array directly.

& - address of - gives the memory address of the variable (in the case of an array,
is it giving the memory address the specific variable in the array)

- - dereference - gives the value of the variable at the provided memory space/
    pointer.

As an analogy, the "address of" is the same as asking what is the apartment number
of the person. The "derefertence" is asking who lives at a specific apartment
number.

What are the benefits of scope minimization in Java? Why is it a good technique to practice? Provide an appropriate source code example to illustrate your points.

Minimizing the scope of your variables helps your application in multiple ways. One way is with memory management. Keeping variables scoped to only the functions that need them reduces the amount of memory needed for permanent objects with garbage collection clearing out memory more often. Scope minimization also helps with thread safety by keeping variables scoped locally you have less need of thread management technique minimizing concurrency issues and reduce the needs for locks.

Maintainability and readability is another reason to keep your variables scoped to only where they are needed. This keeps those variables near the code that impact them. When you have large classes and multiple functions, it is harder to keep track of those variables when they are declared at the top of the class. It makes for easier understanding of the code not only by others, but even for the author.

Finally, security is another reason. The less time sensitive data is maintained in memory the less chance of exploits taking advantage of it (the defense in depth design.) It also reduces the chances of variables being accessed inappropriately, especially when you have large programs being developed across multiple developers. Keeping the variables tightly scoped ensure the data is associated to the functions that need them, no more, no less.

A bad example of scoping variables to an entire class is as simple as as just declaring them at the class scope:

You want them declared at the scope of the methods they are being used. In the case of the above the code itself is written with one class and a big method. The better option is create more discrete methods where you declare the variables you need.

And so on. Break it out into separate methods/functions. This applies to more than just Java. You want your variables scoped to only where they are needed.

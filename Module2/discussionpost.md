Working with strings can lead to various security flaws and errors in software development using the C++ language. What are the common string manipulation errors that can be encountered? How can these errors be resolved and/or limited? What tips can be utilized to identify security vulnerabilities related to strings in C++? Be sure to provide an appropriate source code example to illustrate your points.

According to OWASP (2021) Buffer Overflows is still one of the most common vulnerabilities exploited on both newly developed and legacy applications. Buffer overflow can occur with strings in multiple forms, either the programmer is making a mistake and sending more data than the string variable can handle, or user input does not validate the data being captured and the overflow of data overwrites key memory space, or worse causes arbitrary code to run.

Below is a simple script outlining the use of a CHAR string without doing input validation. You can see where I create a string and allow for input and it actually overwrites a string in an adjacent variable in memory. This is how data corruption can happen. It can also lead to things like arbitrary code execution if adjoining memory space is used for an execution process. Languages like Java, by default, do not allow this to occur, so when writing C++ you have to be very mindful of it as it can cause a lot of issues.

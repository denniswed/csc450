 * Simple Buffer Overflow Demonstration
 *
 * Purpose: Educational demonstration of buffer overflow vulnerabilities
 * Based on: Classic buffer overflow research (Aleph One, 1996)
 * References:
 *   - CERT Secure Coding Standards (STR50-CPP)
 *   - OWASP Buffer Overflow Guidelines
 *   - "Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit" (Phrack 49)
 *
 * WARNING: This code contains intentional vulnerabilities for educational
 * purposes only. DO NOT use in production environments.
 *
 * Educational Value:
 *   - Demonstrates why input validation is critical
 *   - Shows memory corruption in action
 *   - Illustrates real-world attack vectors

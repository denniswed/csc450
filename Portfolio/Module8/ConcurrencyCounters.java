/**
 * Demonstrates proper concurrent counting with thread coordination.

 * PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 * - Uses StringBuilder to minimize string allocation overhead
 * - CountDownLatch for efficient thread coordination (no busy-waiting)
 * - Fixed thread pool to prevent thread creation overhead
 * - Atomic operations where needed for thread safety
 * 
 * SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Immutable counter bounds (final constants)
 * - No data exposure through shared mutable state
 * - Proper exception handling prevents information leakage
 * - Thread interruption handled securely

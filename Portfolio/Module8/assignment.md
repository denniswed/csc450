For your Portfolio Project, you will demonstrate an understanding of the various concepts discussed in each module. For the second part of your Portfolio Project, you will create a Java application that will exhibit concurrency concepts. Your application should create two threads that will act as counters. One thread should count up to 20. Once thread one reaches 20, then a second thread should be used to count down to 0. For your created code, please provide a detailed analysis of appropriate concepts that could impact your application. Specifically, please address:

    Performance issues with concurrency
    Vulnerabilities exhibited with use of strings
    Security of the data types exhibited.
